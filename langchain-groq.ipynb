      "### How to Make the Most of Your Visit\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Plan a “central” day** – Combine Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial, and Lake Burley Griffin (walk or bike around the lake) to cover history, politics, and scenery in one area.\n",
      "2. **Mix indoor and outdoor** – Canberra’s weather can shift quickly. Pair indoor museums (National Museum, Gallery) with outdoor spots (Mount Ainslie, Botanic Gardens) to stay comfortable.\n",
      "3. **Use public transport** – ACTION buses and the free “Canberra Connect” service connect most major attractions. Parking can be limited near the lake, so consider a park‑and‑ride.\n",
      "4. **Check for free events** – The city hosts regular markets (e.g., the Old Bus Depot Markets on Sundays), outdoor concerts, and cultural festivals, especially in the summer months (December–February).\n",
      "5. **Stay hydrated** – Even in mild weather, Canberra’s inland climate can be dry. Carry water, especially on hikes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Sample 2‑Day Itinerary\n",
